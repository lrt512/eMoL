# This is the base URL for your site. It is whatever you have configured
# in your web server to point to the Django application. For example, if
# you have configured your web server to point to the Django application
# at http://yourdomain.com, then this should be "http://yourdomain.com".
# If it's at http://yourdomain.com/emol, then this should be

# ALLOWED_HOSTS is a list of host/domain names that this Django site can serve.
# This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header attacks, which are

# application at http://yourdomain.com, then this should be ["yourdomain.com"].
# If it's at http://yourdomain.com/emol, then this should be ["yourdomain.com"].
